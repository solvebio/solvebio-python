Configuring the Client
-------

The SolveBio python client can be configured by setting system environment variables.
Supported environment variables are:

`SOLVEBIO_API_HOST`     
- The URL of the target API backend. 
If not specified the value from the local credentials file will be used.

`SOLVEBIO_ACCESS_TOKEN` 
- The OAuth2 access token for authenticating with the API.

`SOLVEBIO_API_KEY`       
- The API Key to use for authenticating with the API.

The lookup order for credentials is:
1. Access Token
2. API Key
3. Local Credentials file

`SOLVEBIO_LOGLEVEL` 
- The log level at which to log messages.
If not specified the default log level will be WARN.

`SOLVEBIO_LOGFILE`        
- The file in which to write log messages. 
If the file does not exist it will be created. 
If not specified '~/.solvebio/solvebio.log' will be used by default.

`SOLEVBIO_RETRY_ALL`      
- Flag for enabling aggressive retries for failed requests to the API.
When truthy, the client will attempt to retry a failed request regardless of the type of operation.
This includes idempotent and nonidempotent operations:
"HEAD", "GET", "PUT", "POST", "PATCH", "DELETE", "OPTIONS", "TRACE"
If this value is not set it will default to false and retries will only be enabled for idempotent operations.
