# Depositories

A *depository* (or data repository) is like a source code repository,
but for datasets. Depositories have one or more versions, which in
turn contain one or more datasets. Typically, depositories contain a
series of datasets that are compatible with each other (i.e. they come
from the same data source or project).

Right now, all depositories are curated by the SolveBio team.
