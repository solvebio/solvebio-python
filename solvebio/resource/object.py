        Uses the following rules when processing the path:

            * If no domain, uses the current user's account domain
            * If no vault, uses the current user's personal vault.
            * If no path, uses '/' (vault root)

            * The validated full_path
            * A dictionary with the components:
                * domain: the domain of the vault

                * filename: the object's filename (if any)
                * full_path: the validated full path

        The following components may be overridden using kwargs:

            * vault
            * path

        Object paths (also known as "paths") must begin with a forward slash.

        The following path formats are supported:

            domain:vault:/path -> object "path" in the root of "domain:vault"
            domain:vault/path  -> object "path" in the root of "domain:vault"

            vault/             -> root of "vault"
            ~/                 -> root of your personal vault

        The following two formats are not supported:

            path               -> invalid/ambiguous path (exception)
            vault:path         -> invalid/ambiguous path (exception)
